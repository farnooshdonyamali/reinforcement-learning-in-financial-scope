# reinforcement-learning-in-financial-scope
in this work I design a voter system which included four deep reinforcement learning algorithms;
A2C,PPO, DDPG and SAC.
this voter choose the best action concluded of the pre-traind DRL agents and make a decision in financial environment based on this action.
this action would be the best choice and help the investors to gain much more profit.
In conclusion voter agent reach the highest reward and according to the indicators have defined in this project voter system work very well in all of them compared to the other DRL agents.
